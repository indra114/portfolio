                <h3>Mini shopping mall</h3>
                <p>The Minnishopping C project is focused on developing a streamlined 
                    and efficient console-based shopping application using the 
                    C programming language. This project involves creating an 
                    interface where users can browse products, add items to their 
                    shopping cart, and proceed to checkout, all within a text-based 
                    environment. Key features include a well-organized product 
                    catalog, user authentication, and secure payment processing. 
                    The project aims to implement efficient data structures and 
                    algorithms to manage inventory and user data, ensuring optimal 
                    performance and ease of use. By leveraging the power and 
                    simplicity of C, this project offers a foundational approach to 
                    understanding core programming concepts in the context of a 
                    practical application.</p>

                <h3>Customer Billing System</h3>
                <p>The Customer Billing System DS project in C is designed to 
                    manage and streamline the billing process in a retail 
                    environment using data structures such as stacks and 
                    queues. This project involves developing a 
                    console-based application where customers' purchase 
                    details are handled efficiently. Stacks are utilized 
                    for undoing the most recent transactions, while queues 
                    manage the order of customer billing, ensuring a 
                    first-come, first-served process. Key features include 
                    adding items to a customer's bill, processing payments, 
                    and generating detailed billing statements. 
                    By leveraging stacks and queues, the system ensures 
                    orderly processing and provides the capability to 
                    reverse transactions, making it a robust and reliable 
                    billing solution.</p>

                <h3>Parking lot</h3>
                <p>The Parking Lot C++ project is an application designed to 
                    manage and automate the operations of a parking 
                    facility. This project involves developing a 
                    console-based system that tracks vehicle entries and 
                    exits, allocates parking spots, and calculates parking 
                    fees. Key features include real-time monitoring of 
                    available spaces, efficient spot allocation using data 
                    structures like arrays or linked lists, and a 
                    user-friendly interface for both parking attendants 
                    and customers. The project also implements algorithms 
                    to handle peak hours and ensure optimal utilization of 
                    parking spaces. By leveraging the capabilities of C++, 
                    this project provides a practical solution for 
                    managing parking lots efficiently and effectively.</p>
